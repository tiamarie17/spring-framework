# Description:
This is a project I completed through a course on Pluralsight called Spring Framework: Spring 5 Fundamentals. This app manages registrationn for speakers at a conference. I used Java configuration and 
annotations to wire the app. I used different forms of dependency injection such as setter injection and constructor injection in order to make the code more maintainable. I also later changed the app so that it would be fully autowired.


##Technologies Used:
Java, Maven, Spring
